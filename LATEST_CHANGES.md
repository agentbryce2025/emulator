# Latest Changes - March 2025

## Machine Learning Sensor Data Generation

The undetected Android emulator now includes a sophisticated machine learning component for generating realistic sensor data patterns. This enhancement significantly improves our ability to bypass emulator detection mechanisms that rely on analyzing sensor data patterns.

### Features Added:

1. **ML-based Sensor Generation**: Added the `MLSensorGenerator` class that can generate realistic sensor data patterns using Random Forest models.
2. **Training Data Generation**: Implemented synthetic training data generation for initial model training.
3. **Activity Recognition**: Sensor patterns now reflect different activities (walking, running, stationary, driving).
4. **Device Position Awareness**: Generated patterns account for device position (flat, tilted, vertical, upside-down).
5. **Visual Output**: Added plotting capabilities to visualize sensor patterns for validation.
6. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implemented graceful fallback to rule-based generation when ML is unavailable.
7. **User Contribution System**: Added a framework for users to contribute their own sensor data for training improved models.

### Test Improvements:

1. **Import Path Fixes**: Fixed import issues in the test framework to improve maintainability and reliability.
2. **Profile Validation**: Enhanced testing of device profiles with automated validation.
3. **Automated Testing Framework**: Improved the framework for testing emulator detection bypass.

### Visual Examples:

Added `ml_accelerometer_walking_tilted.png` as a visual demonstration of ML-generated sensor patterns for a device in tilted position during walking activity.

## Next Steps

1. **Community Contribution System**: Develop a full system for community members to contribute emulator detection methods and countermeasures.
2. **Plugin System**: Create a plugin architecture for custom detection bypasses.
3. **Cloud Profile Database**: Implement a secure cloud database for sharing device profiles and sensor patterns.
4. **Multiple Instance Support**: Add support for running multiple emulator instances simultaneously.
5. **Telemetry System**: Develop a telemetry framework for monitoring emulator performance and detection bypass effectiveness.

## Running the Latest Code

To test the ML sensor generation:

```bash
python test_ml_sensors.py
```

To see available device profiles:

```bash
python test_runner.py --list-profiles
```

Note: Running the full emulator requires QEMU and an Android-x86 system image.
