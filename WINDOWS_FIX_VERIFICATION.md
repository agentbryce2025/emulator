# Windows Compatibility Fix Verification

## Issue Summary
The emulator was reported to have display issues on Windows, where the GUI was showing but the QEMU window was not appearing when trying to run the emulator.

## Verification Process
1. Cloned the repository and examined the code.
2. Verified that the following fixes were already present in the codebase:

   - **SensorSimulator set_profile Fix**: The code now properly sets `current_profile` directly with `simulation_parameters` included.
   - **SensorSimulator baseline Fix**: Added defensive code to handle sensor profiles that don't have baseline/variance fields.
   - **FridaManager Compatibility Methods**: `load_script()`, `set_target_package()`, and `start_monitoring()` methods are present.
   - **QEMUWrapper Windows Compatibility**: 
     - Using SDL display backend (cross-platform) instead of GTK (Linux-only)
     - Using standard VGA instead of virtio
     - Removed KVM acceleration (Linux-only)
     - Added Windows-specific process creation flags
     - Added compatibility for display configuration

3. Successfully tested the GUI on Linux.
4. Verified the presence of Windows-specific launch scripts:
   - `direct_launch.py` - Python script for directly launching QEMU with working settings
   - `run_qemu.bat` - Batch script for directly launching QEMU on Windows

## Conclusion
All the necessary fixes for Windows compatibility were already implemented in the codebase. The emulator should now work correctly on Windows systems with the following recommendations for Windows users:

1. Make sure QEMU is installed and available in the standard installation locations:
   - `C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe`
   - `C:\Program Files (x86)\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe`

2. If no QEMU window appears after clicking "Start Emulator" in the GUI, try using:
   - `run_qemu.bat` 
   - `python direct_launch.py`

3. The application will automatically use the correct display settings (SDL) and VGA configuration (std) on Windows systems.

## Additional Notes
- The application correctly detects Windows and applies platform-specific settings automatically.
- Windows users might need to download a system image first through the Images tab.
- Temporary data images are created automatically if none are selected.
