# Anti-Detection Mechanisms

This directory contains modules to bypass common emulator detection techniques:

- `hardware_spoof.py`: Hardware identifier spoofing
- `virtualization_mask.py`: Virtualization detection countermeasures
- `sensor_simulator.py`: Realistic sensor data simulation
- `api_hooks.py`: System API interception and modification
- `frida_scripts/`: Frida scripts for runtime manipulation
- `xposed_modules/`: Xposed modules for system-level modifications

Implementation details will be added as development progresses.
