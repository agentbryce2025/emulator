# Android UI Issue Fix - Summary

## Issue Description
The emulator was failing to display the Android phone UI after being launched, showing the error:
```
"No target package or script content set"
```

This occurred because the Frida manager was trying to inject a script into an app that wasn't specified, but no default app was being provided when none was explicitly set.

## Fix Implementation
The following changes were made to address the issue:

1. **Modified Frida Manager (`src/anti_detection/frida_manager.py`)**:
   - Updated the `start_monitoring()` method to use the Android launcher as a default target package when none is specified
   - Added a default empty script when no script content is provided
   - This ensures the emulator can start without requiring a specific target app

2. **Created Default Launcher Script (`src/anti_detection/frida_scripts/default_launcher.js`)**:
   - Added a specialized Frida script that helps ensure the Android UI launches correctly
   - Implements hooks to bypass setup wizards and intro screens
   - Ensures the home screen launcher is started
   
3. **Updated QEMU Wrapper (`src/core/qemu_wrapper.py`)**:
   - Added Android-specific boot parameters to the QEMU command line
   - Set parameters including `skipsetup=1` to bypass initial setup screens
   - Improved boot process to go directly to the launcher

4. **Updated Main Script (`main.py`)**:
   - Changed the default script from `detection_bypass.js` to `default_launcher.js`
   - This ensures the default script actually helps with UI initialization

## Testing
The fix was tested by:
1. Running the emulator with the updated code
2. Verifying that the "No target package or script content set" error no longer appears
3. Confirming the Android UI correctly loads when the emulator starts

## Future Improvements
For further enhancements:
1. Implement better error handling for cases where the Android launcher doesn't start
2. Add support for alternative Android launchers
3. Improve documentation about the default launcher behavior
4. Add logging to help diagnose UI startup issues

## Summary
The fix addresses the core issue by providing default values for both the target package and script content, ensuring the emulator can launch and display the Android UI without requiring explicit configuration.
