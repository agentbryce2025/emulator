# Undetected Android Emulator - March 2025 Update

## New Features and Improvements

We're excited to announce significant enhancements to the Undetected Android Emulator project!

### 1. Android-x86 Image Management
- **Automatic Image Download**: Easily download Android-x86 images directly from the GUI
- **Multiple Version Support**: Images available for Android 6.0 through 9.0
- **Persistent Storage**: Create and manage data images for persistent storage between sessions

### 2. Realistic Device Profile Database
- **Pre-configured Device Profiles**: Includes detailed profiles for popular devices
  - Samsung Galaxy S21
  - Google Pixel 6
  - Xiaomi Redmi Note 10
- **Custom Profile Creation**: Create your own device profiles with detailed hardware specifications
- **Profile Import/Export**: Share and import device profiles with other users

### 3. Enhanced Anti-Detection Features
- **LinkedIn-specific Bypass**: Dedicated script for bypassing LinkedIn's emulator detection
- **Advanced Sensor Simulation**: Realistic sensor data that mimics actual device behavior
- **Comprehensive API Hooking**: Hooks into a wide range of Android APIs used for detection
- **Touch Input Randomization**: Makes automated input appear more human-like

### 4. Improved User Interface
- **Tab-based Organization**: Easy access to all features through an intuitive tabbed interface
- **Quick Setup**: One-click configuration for common use cases
- **Real-time Status**: Monitor emulator status and resource usage
- **Integrated Logging**: View and save detailed logs for troubleshooting

### 5. Command Line Interface
- **Headless Mode**: Run the emulator without GUI for automation and testing
- **Configurable Options**: Extensive command-line options for customization
- **LinkedIn Mode**: Special mode optimized for bypassing LinkedIn detection

## Installation and Usage

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/agentbryce2025/emulator.git
cd emulator

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Running the Emulator
```bash
# With GUI
python main.py

# Headless mode with LinkedIn-specific detection bypass
python main.py --no-gui --linkedin-mode --target-app com.linkedin.android
```

## New Feature: Automated Testing Framework
We're excited to announce the addition of an automated testing framework that helps verify the effectiveness of our emulator detection bypasses:

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Automatically tests against various detection methods
- **Device Profile Testing**: Runs tests against all device profiles to ensure consistent bypass
- **Detailed Reports**: Generates CSV reports with test results and detection methods used
- **Simple Command-Line Interface**: Easy to integrate into CI/CD pipelines
- **LinkedIn-Specific Tests**: Specialized tests for LinkedIn's detection methods

### Usage
```bash
# Run automated tests with default settings
python -m src.test.automated_detection_test

# Test with a specific device profile
python -m src.test.automated_detection_test --profile "Google Pixel 6"

# Specify Android version and test duration
python -m src.test.automated_detection_test --android-version 9.0 --duration 120
```

## Future Development
Our roadmap includes:
- More device profiles with realistic hardware configurations
- Behavioral analysis to detect and prevent emulator detection
- Cloud profile database for community-contributed device profiles
- Support for running multiple emulator instances simultaneously
- Machine learning for realistic sensor pattern generation
